# ComfyUI Gemini Expanded API Node

This is a Google Gemini API integration node for ComfyUI, supporting text generation and image generation functions. With this node, you can directly use Google's Gemini 2.0 series models in your ComfyUI workflow.
Special Note: Regarding the error [ERROR]API call error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'parts', it means that the image or prompt you uploaded violates the "Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy". Please test with general scene or product images first to ensure compliance.

## Updates
2024.3.19: Updated to support multi-image processing.
## Features

- Supports Gemini 2.x and 3.x series models
- Supports text-to-text generation
- Supports image-to-text generation (image understanding)
- Supports text-to-image generation (Note: this functionality is implemented in separate .py files, not directly within this node.)
- Built-in proxy support for convenient use by users in China
- Automatic dependency checking and installation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Installation Method

1. Ensure you have ComfyUI installed.
2. Clone or download this repository into ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory:
   ```
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/silveroxides/ComfyUI_Gemini_Expanded_API.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ComfyUI_Gemini_Expanded_API
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Restart ComfyUI.

## How to Use

### 1. Configure Gemini API or Enterprise/Vertex AI

### Option A(Gemini API)

First, you need to obtain a Google Gemini API key:
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys) or [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create an API key (In Google Cloud Console it is recommended to set key restriction to the Generative Language API)
3. In ComfyUI, locate and use the `Configure Gemini API Key` node to enter your API key.

### Option B (Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform, formerly Vertex AI)
1. Start by visiting [Google Cloud Console Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/aiplatform.googleapis.com/overview) and enable it.
2. Visit the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) and select a Google Gemini model and then "view code" button.
3. Read the instructions for the chosen model at "Try (Python)" for environment authentication or "Try while using express mode (Python)" for API-key authentication.
4. For environment authentication, set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`, and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE=true` before launching ComfyUI. Existing installations may continue using `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`; the node supports both names, with `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE` taking precedence if both are set.
5. In ComfyUI, locate and use the `Configure Gemini API Key` node and set `use_vertexai_env` to `true`.
6. For Enterprise express mode, enter its API key and enable `vertexai_express`; project and location are not required for this mode.

### 2. Text Generation

Use the `Expanded Gemini Text/Image` node for text generation:

- Connect the API key configuration node to the `config` input.
- Enter your prompt text in `prompt`.
- Adjust generation parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.).
- If needed, connect images through `image_inputs`. For video, pass a native ComfyUI video through `Configure Gemini Video Input`, then connect its output to `video`.
- Configured video is normalized to MP4/H.264 and sent with embedded audio at the selected sampling FPS. `pad_at_start` optionally prepends black video and silence. `duration_aware_padding` derives that padding from the video's fractional-second duration and rounds it down to native video frames for comparison testing. The normalized video must be smaller than 100 MB.
- Enable `use_cache` on the configuration node to reuse unchanged prompt, system instruction, image, and video context through Gemini after the local result cache misses.

### 3. Proxy Settings

If you are in China or other regions requiring a proxy:

1. Set `use_proxy` to `True`.
2. Set `proxy_host` (default is 127.0.0.1).
3. Set `proxy_port` (default is 7890).

## Parameter Description

### API Key Configuration Node

- `api_key`: Google Gemini API key
- `use_cache`: Enable Gemini API context caching. Disabled by default.
- `cache_ttl_minutes`: Number of minutes Gemini retains cached context.
- `cache_seed`: Generation seed used while `use_cache` is enabled.

### Video Input Configuration Node

- `video`: Native ComfyUI video input.
- `fps`: Gemini sampling rate from 1 through 24 FPS.
- `pad_at_start`: Prepend matching-resolution black video and silence for half one sampling interval before encoding.
- `duration_aware_padding`: With start padding enabled, use the video's fractional-second duration rounded down to native video frames instead of the standard padding duration.

### Response Schema Builder

Add **Configure Gemini Response Schema** under `API/Gemini`. Choose the **Type** of the response. **Object** starts empty, with an **Add field** control.

1. Use **Add field** to choose a type, such as **Text** or **Integer**. A new bordered entry appears inside its parent.
2. Enter its **Name**, set **Required**, and add a **Description** if needed. Hover over a control for a plain-language explanation.
3. Choose **Object** for a group of named fields or **Array** for a list of items. Children appear inside the parent's border with a small indentation.
4. Choose **Disabled** to leave a field out while retaining its settings. Use **Remove** to delete the field and all its nested definitions completely.
5. Queue the node to produce the `GEMINI_RESPONSE_SCHEMA` dictionary and formatted `schema_json` string. The JSON is also returned as a text preview.

There is no fixed field count or container-depth cutoff in the builder. Only actual authored entries are stored. Generated property order follows field creation order. This does not remove runtime or provider schema-complexity limits.

- **Text:** defaults to **Any text**. Choose **From list** under **Allowed values** to enter one allowed answer per line.
- **Integer / Number:** **Minimum** and **Maximum** each offer **No limit / Set limit**.
- **Boolean:** asks the AI for a yes-or-no answer. It does not set that answer in advance.
- Names are trimmed and must be nonempty and unique among enabled siblings. Descriptions retain their text. Invalid active enums or numeric bounds identify the affected field.
- An empty object emits empty properties; not every provider/model necessarily accepts that schema.

Type changes retain inactive settings, including object children and array items. Save and reopen the workflow to restore the complete configuration. The JSON authoring state is stored internally; you do not edit it directly.

The editor is one ComfyUI DOM widget with scoped styles. Entries use compact borders and padding. Each section has a **Collapse / Expand** button: it hides settings while leaving the header accessible and does not omit any information from the output. Collapsed sections are saved with the workflow. Descriptions use a single line; allowed-value lists remain multiline. Resize the node to adjust the editor area; long content scrolls inside it. Existing version-1 builder state remains compatible.

After updating, restart ComfyUI, refresh the page, and recreate nodes from the previous fixed-slot prototype. Old prototype inputs are not silently migrated. Check nested field creation, disabling/re-enabling, type switching, queue output, and save/reopen behavior in your live frontend.

This builder makes no API requests. Connect its **schema** output to **Response format** on **Expanded Gemini Text/Image**. That optional input appears after video and immediately before the growing image inputs. Leave it disconnected for a normal answer. The schema output can also connect directly to Core's **Preview as Text**; **schema_json** is the same schema already formatted as text.

With a response format connected, the request uses JSON formatting and returns the final JSON in both **text** and **structured_output**. Input images and video can still be analyzed. Active image generation cannot be combined with a response format. Invalid JSON is reported as a processing error rather than repaired. Changing the format causes a new generation, while unchanged cached input context can be reused.

For development tests, run `npm ci` once to install the test-only DOM library, then use `tests/run_tests.py --group response_schema` with the configured ComfyUI Python. The browser editor itself has no npm runtime dependency. DOM tests check structure and events; they do not replace checking actual canvas positioning, zoom, and layout in ComfyUI.

### Text Generation Node

#### Required Parameters

- `config`: API key configuration
- `prompt`: Prompt text
- `model`: Select model (gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-2.0-pro)
- `temperature`: Generation temperature (0.0-1.0), controls the randomness and creativity of the output.
- `top_p`: Nucleus sampling parameter (0.0-1.0)
- `top_k`: Number of candidate tokens to consider (1-100). Higher values mean more diversity.
- `max_output_tokens`: Maximum output tokens (1-8192)
- `include_images`: Whether to include images in the response (True/False)

#### Optional Parameters

- `video`: Optional `GEMINI_VIDEO_CONFIG` input. Its video is sent before images and prompt with embedded audio.
- `response_schema` (**Response format**): Optional `GEMINI_RESPONSE_SCHEMA` input from the builder's **schema** output; placed immediately before Autogrow.
- `image_inputs`: Optional ordered image autogrow inputs for image understanding.
- `use_proxy`: Whether to use a proxy (True/False)
- `proxy_host`: Proxy host address
- `proxy_port`: Proxy port

## Output

Text generation node output:

1. `text`: Final answer text, excluding returned thoughts.
2. `image`: Generated image when image generation is enabled; otherwise the existing empty image output.
3. `final_actual_seed`: The final generation seed.
4. `structured_output`: Final JSON text when a connected response format succeeds; otherwise empty.
5. `thoughts`: Returned thought text from the accepted response; otherwise empty. `include_thoughts` controls requesting it.

The first three output positions remain unchanged. Errors and timeout fallbacks remain in `text`; `structured_output` and `thoughts` are empty on failure. Failed requests are not stored as successful cached results. JSON parsing checks syntax, not factual correctness or full schema compliance.

## Precautions/Notes
- According to Google's "Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy", Gemini API has the following restrictions:
- Must not be used to generate content that violates laws and regulations.
- Must not be used to generate harmful, fraudulent, pornographic, or violent content.
- Must not be used to generate content that infringes on others' privacy or intellectual property rights.
- Image generation may have additional restrictions, and certain types of images might not be generatable.

- Using this node requires a stable network connection or effective proxy settings.
- API requests may be affected by Google server load.
- Large requests may require longer processing times.
- The image generation feature requires a model that explicitly supports it (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter network connection problems, please check your proxy settings.
- If API requests fail, please check if your API key is valid.
- If dependency installation fails, please manually install the required dependency packages.
